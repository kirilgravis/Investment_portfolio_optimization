### Data Processing
The code, written in Python, leverages Pandas to read and process financial data from a CSV file. The data consists of stock information for various companies over a specific time frame.

### Portfolio Optimization
Utilizing mean returns and covariance matrices derived from the dataset, the code constructs and evaluates different investment portfolios. It applies the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to identify portfolios offering maximum Sharpe ratios and minimum volatility.

### Displaying Results
The `display_simulated_ef_with_random` function showcases key portfolio allocations, such as those with the maximum Sharpe ratio and minimum volatility. It provides details on annualized returns, volatilities, and visual representations of the efficient frontier through scatter plots.

## Usage
To utilize this code:
1. Ensure Python and necessary libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy) are installed.
2. Adjust the file path within the code to load your financial data.
3. Modify parameters for portfolio optimization as required (e.g., risk-free rate, number of portfolios to simulate).

## How to Run
1. Execute the code file within a Python environment.
2. Review the console or output for insights into optimized portfolio allocations, annualized returns, volatilities, and visualizations depicting the efficient frontier.
